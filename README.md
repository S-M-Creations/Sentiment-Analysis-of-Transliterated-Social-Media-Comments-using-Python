## 📜 **Project Overview**

Welcome to **Sentiment Analysis of Transliterated Social Media Comments!** This project dives into analyzing the sentiment of social media comments, specifically from YouTube and Twitter (X), using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to assess the overall mood (positive, negative, or neutral) of user comments on various platforms and provide insightful analysis for content creators and marketers.

---

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### 1. **Platform Selection:**
- You can choose to analyze comments from **YouTube**, **Twitter**, or **Instagram** (coming soon). Simply click on the platform of your choice.

### 2. **Input Your URL:**
- For **YouTube**: Paste the URL of a YouTube video to fetch the latest comments.
- For **Twitter**: Paste the URL of a tweet to fetch the replies.

### 3. **Processing & Analysis:**
- The application will **preprocess** the comments by removing unnecessary text like URLs, emojis, and handles, while keeping non-ASCII characters (such as Telugu).
- **Sentiment Analysis** will then classify each comment as either **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.
- **Translation**: If comments are not in English, they will be automatically **transliterated and translated** to English for analysis.

### 4. **Results:**
- The app will present a **detailed analysis** of the comments, along with a **pie chart** showing the sentiment distribution.
- You can download the results in **CSV** format for further analysis.

### 🌐 **Multilingual Handling**:
Supports multiple languages and retains non-ASCII characters like **Telugu** while removing unwanted characters (e.g., emojis).

### 📥 **Downloadable Results**:
Once the analysis is complete, the results can be downloaded in a **CSV** format to further study or integrate into other applications.

### 📊 **Data Visualization**:
A **pie chart** visualizes the sentiment distribution, showing you how people feel overall about the content.
